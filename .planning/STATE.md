# Project State: Zenith Grid (Tic-Tac-Toe)

## Overview

- **Status:** Milestone complete
- **Current Phase:** 09
- **Last Updated:** 2026-04-08

## Planka Tracking

- **Project ID:** 1748557981382870045
- **Board ID:** 1748558091659510815
- **Lists:**
  - Todo: 1748582506266887205
  - In Progress: 1748582538210706470
  - Done: 1748582561136772135

### Convention

Planka is a secondary tracking system. Keep it in sync whenever STATE.md is updated:

- When a phase/plan is **started**: create a card in "In Progress" list titled "{Phase N} — {Phase Name}" (or move existing card from Todo).
- When a phase/plan is **completed**: move its card to the "Done" list.
- When a quick task is **completed**: add a comment to the relevant phase card, or create a short-lived card in Done titled "Quick: {task-id}".
- Use the MCP `mcp__planka__*` tools (create_card, update_card, move_card) with the IDs above.
- Do NOT block phase execution on Planka failures — Planka sync is best-effort.

## Recent Activity

- **2026-04-08:** Completed Phase 9, Plan 4 (Profile Picture Display) — code tasks done, awaiting human-verify checkpoint:
    - Wired Coil AsyncImage in ProfileScreen to display profilePicturePath from ViewModel.
    - Wired Coil AsyncImage in MainMenuScreen ProfileCard using profilePicturePath parameter.
    - Full end-to-end flow ready for verification (camera/gallery → save → display on both screens → persist across restart).
- **2026-04-06:** Completed Phase 9, Plan 3 (Profile Picture Storage):
    - Updated `PreferenceRepository` to store the profile picture path.
    - Implemented logic in `ProfileViewModel` to save the image to internal storage.

- **2026-04-01:** Completed Phase 5 (Polish & Aesthetics):
    - Implemented `SoundManager` with `SoundPool` for low-latency audio feedback.
    - Added piece placement animations (scale + fade) with spring physics.
    - Developed `WinLineOverlay` for animated win line drawing.
    - Integrated `ConfettiEffect` particle system for victory celebration.
    - Created `AboutScreen` with app info and credits.

    - Developed and verified three difficulty levels for `CpuPlayer`.
    - Achieved 100% unit test coverage for engine and AI logic.
    - Verified "Hard" AI as unbeatable through automated simulations.
- **2026-03-30:** Completed Phase 1 (Foundation & Navigation):
    - Established architectural package structure and established foundation.
    - Configured typed navigation using Jetpack Navigation and Kotlin Serialization.
    - Redesigned `MainMenuScreen` to follow "The Elevated Playfield" design system.
    - Implemented auto-advance logic on `SplashScreen` with backstack clearing.
